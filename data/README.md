- Will contain prediction files and analysis results as models are run


## üîÑ Data Journey

### Stage 1: Raw Data Collection
- Original files are stored exactly as received from different sources
- No modifications made to preserve data integrity
- Serves as the permanent backup and reference point

### Stage 2: Data Cleaning & Integration
- Raw data is processed to fix errors and inconsistencies
- Multiple sources are standardized to work together
- Invalid or unrealistic values are corrected or removed
- Results in clean, analysis-ready datasets

### Stage 3: Master Dataset Creation
- All cleaned files are combined into one comprehensive dataset
- Relationships between different data sources are established
- Additional calculated fields are created for analysis
- Results in the `full_join.xlsx` file ready for machine learning

## üìä Data Quality Improvements

### What We Fixed:
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized supplier names across all files (e.g., "SuplA" ‚Üí "SupplierA")
- **Product Codes**: Corrected invalid product reference formats
- **Data Types**: Ensured numbers are properly formatted and dates are consistent
- **Missing Values**: Handled gaps in data appropriately
- **Outliers**: Identified and corrected unrealistic values

### Quality Checks Performed:
- Validation of product reference codes against standard format
- Cross-referencing supplier names across different datasets
- Verification of numeric ranges (weights, costs, quantities)
- Date format standardization and timeline validation

## üéØ How to Use This Data

### For Business Analysis:
- **Start with preprocessed files** for any analysis or reporting
- **Use full_join.xlsx** for comprehensive insights across all data sources
- **Refer to original files** only when you need to verify specific details

### For Machine Learning:
- **full_join.xlsx** is the primary dataset for model training
- Contains all necessary features and target variables
- Pre-processed to ensure model compatibility

### For Data Validation:
- **Compare original vs. preprocessed** to understand what changes were made
- **Use SbS_data_guide.pdf** to understand field definitions
- **Check data lineage** by tracing from original through to master dataset

## üîç Key Insights Available

## üö® Important Notes

### Data Freshness:
- Check file timestamps to understand when data was last updated
- Original files should be updated regularly from source systems
- Preprocessed files need to be regenerated when original data changes

### Data Security:
- Contains sensitive business information about suppliers and costs
- Should be handled according to company data privacy policies
- Access should be limited to authorized personnel only

### Data Limitations:
- Historical data may not reflect current business conditions
- Some data cleaning decisions involved assumptions that should be validated
- Missing data for certain time periods or products may affect analysis
